    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These crispy, pan seared and juicy Lemon Garlic Butter Scallops are the ultimate treat when it comes to scallop recipes! Serve as a starter or main, nothing melts in your mouth quite like tender-crisp and buttery scallops.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 1/4 pounds (600 grams) scallops</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided</li>
        <li>4-5 large garlic cloves, minced (or 1 1/2 tablespoons minced garlic)</li>
        <li>Salt and fresh ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1/4 cup dry white wine or broth</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>If scallops are frozen, thaw in cold water. Remove the side muscle from the scallops if attached. Thoroughly pat dry with paper towels.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large pan or skillet over medium-high heat until hot and sizzling. Add the scallops in a single layer without over crowding the pan (work in batches if needed).</li>
        <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste and fry for 2-3 minutes on one side (until a golden crust forms underneath), then flip and fry again for 2 minutes until crisp, lightly browned and cooked through (opaque). Remove from skillet and transfer to a plate.</li>
        <li>Melt 2 tablespoons of butter in the same pan, scraping up any browned bits left over from the scallops. Add in the garlic and cook until fragrant (1 minute).</li>
        <li>Pour in wine (or broth) and bring to a simmer for 2 minutes or until wine reduces by about half. Stir in the remaining tablespoon of butter and lemon juice.</li>
        <li>Remove pan (skillet) from the heat; add the scallops back into the pan to warm through slightly and garnish with parsley.</li>
        <li>Serve over rice, pasta, garlic bread or steamed vegetables (cauliflower, broccoli, zucchini noodles).</li>
    </ol>
